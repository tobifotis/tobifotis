## Featured Projects

## 🔹 [Terraform ECS Three-Tier Architecture](https://github.com/tobifotis/terraform-ecs-project)


Designed and provisioned a production-style, multi-AZ AWS environment using Terraform, following a network-level three-tier architecture.

- Designed a multi-AZ VPC with public, private application, and isolated data subnets enforcing clear network boundaries
- Deployed a containerized web application on ECS Fargate behind an HTTPS Application Load Balancer
- Implemented auto scaling, least-privilege security groups, and controlled outbound access via NAT gateways
- Provisioned a private RDS database layer accessible only from the application tier
- Focused on infrastructure clarity, isolation, and scalability rather than application features


**Stack:** Terraform, AWS VPC, ECS Fargate, Application Load Balancer, RDS, Route 53, IAM, ACM, CloudWatch
